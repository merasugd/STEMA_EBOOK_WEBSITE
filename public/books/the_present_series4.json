Nasa kanya na kasi ang lahat: fame, power, beauty, and Adam—the man she had always loved since she was five. Pero hindi. Dahil ikakasal man sila ni Adam, arranged marriage lang iyon. Ni minsan, hindi niya naramdaman na mahalaga siya sa kanyang fiancé. Si Dean, ang executive assistant ni Adam ang parating to the rescue sa kanya at ang ipinapadala ng fiancé tuwing may date sila at busy ito sa trabaho. Until one day, Selena fell in love with Dean. And she was happy. Dahil sa kauna-unahang pagkakataon, nagmahal siya at mahal din siya. It was supposed to be the start of their beautiful story. Pero kabaliktaran ang nangyari. Nobody approved of their love. Nagpasya silang lumayo. Pero sa pagtakas nila ay naaksidente si Selena at nagkaroon ng amnesia. Paggising niya ay hindi na niya maalala si Dean. All she could remember was her life before Dean came—happily engaged to the prince. Dean didn’t know just how long he could endure it. Hindi niya alam kung kakapit pa o bibitaw na. Could they still have their once-upon-a-time moment? ",
