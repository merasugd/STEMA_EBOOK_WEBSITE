Set in a post‑apocalyptic world where humanity has lost all emotions except fear, the story follows Rom Sebastian — the first “Mortal” — and a secret group of living, feeling humans who fight against a cold, emotionless Order. As the Mortals struggle with betrayal, war, and the hope of resurrecting true life and emotion in the world, the novel explores themes of identity, faith, life, death, and what it means to be truly alive.",
